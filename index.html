            <h2>Hurrem Sultan</h2>
            <p>Hurrem Sultan (Turkish pronunciation: [hyɾˈɾæm suɫˈtan], Ottoman Turkish: حرم سلطان‎, romanized: Ḫurrem
                Sulṭān, Modern
                Turkish: Hürrem Sultan; c. 1502 – 15 April 1558), also known as Roxelana (Ukrainian: Роксолана;
                lit. 'the Ruthenian
                one'), was the chief consort and wife of the Ottoman sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. She became one of
                the most
                powerful and influential women in Ottoman history as well as a prominent and controversial figure during
                the era known
                as the Sultanate of Women.

                Hurrem eventually achieved power, influencing the politics of the Ottoman Empire. Through her husband,
                she played an
                active role in affairs of the state. She probably acted as the sultan's advisor, wrote diplomatic
                letters to King
                Sigismund II Augustus of Poland (r. 1548–1572) and patronized major public works (including the Haseki
                Sultan Complex
                and the Hurrem Sultan Bathhouse). She died in 1558, in Istanbul and was buried in a mausoleum within the
                Süleymaniye
                Mosque complex.</p>

            <h2>Hatiche Sultan</h2>
            <p>Hatice's birth date is unknown, but she had to be born before 1494.[2] She was the daughter of Şehzade
                Selim (the future
                Selim I) and his concubine Hafsa. She may have married Damat Iskender Pasha in 1509, an Ottoman governor
                and later
                admiral who was executed in 1515.[2]

                It had long been believed that Hatice Sultan subsequently married the Grand Vizier Pargalı Ibrahim
                Pasha. However, in
                the late 2000s research conducted by the historian Ebru Turan revealed that this claim was not based on
                solid evidence,
                and that in fact no such marriage ever took place between them. As a result, historians now generally
                agree that Ibrahim
                married another woman, Muhsine Hatun, and not Hatice.[3]</p>

                Suleiman the
                Magnificent. Her mother was Hurrem Sultan,[9][10][11] an Orthodox priest's daughter,[12] who was the
                current Sultan's
                concubine at the time. In 1533 or 1534, her mother, Hurrem, was freed and became Suleiman's legal
                wife.[13] She had five
                brothers, Şehzade Mehmed, Şehzade Abdullah, who died at the age of three years, Şehzade Selim (future
                Selim II), Şehzade
                Bayezid, and Şehzade Cihangir.[9][10] She was well-educated and disciplined. She was also sophisticated,
                eloquent and
                wellread.[4]</p>
